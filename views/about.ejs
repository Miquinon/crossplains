    <p class="information">Cross Plains Oil Field Supply Company started out in an old machine shop more than 40 years ago in 
        Cross Plains, Texas. By the late 1970s, to meet the needs of the changing and growing oil and gas drilling 
        market, we built and opened our store in Mineral Wells, Texas.

        For over 40 years, Cross Plains Oil Field Supply Company has evolved to meet industry demands, expanding 
        our offerings, services, and ability to reach customers where they operate. Backed by a dedicated team and 
        an extensive inventory, along with over 25 cargo “hookup” parts trailers, we remain fully committed to 
        supporting the current and future needs of the oil and gas industry.
